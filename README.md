This is my web app for viewing people. 

This repository encompasses both the server and client. The server is built with Node.Js, Express, Webpack, Sqllite3, and superagent.
The client is built with React and Material UI. The tests are configuration with jest, eslint, and enzyme. 
The UI should be fairly easy to follow. All functionality requested is in place. 

## Installation

Setup:

Clone application

```bash
npm install
```
Run application:

```bash
node server/app.js
```

Visit:

http://localhost:3000/


# Testing

```bash
npm run test
```

# Improvements

- Error handling, my application is currently just console.logging errors
- Better test coverage. I tried to give a sample of different tests without going overboard
- Form validation. I did not address form validation for adding a user.
